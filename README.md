Problem Statement:
Create a simple model consisting of a sender S and a receiver R.
The sender creates new messages at a random time interval T and sends it to the receiver. 
The receiver records the inter-arrival times of the messages.
Choose at least two different probability distributions for the random variable T:
Draw the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the distribution using MATLAB, Python or any other tool you prefer.
Record and visualize the histogram and vector data of the inter-arrival times of the received messages when you stop the simulation after 100, 1000, and 10000 messages.
What are the sample mean, sample variance and the standard deviation of the simulation results?
